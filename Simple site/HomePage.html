								Hello and welcome to my free guitar lesson web site!
							</p>
							<p>
								There are many hundreds of free guitar lessons here, most with video and audio, and as you can
								imagine it's taken quite a lot of work for me to put it together. It's important to me to help
								everyone that wants to learn to play the guitar, not just those with money to spend on tuition,
								so I run it on an <strong> honour system </strong> .
							</p>
							<p>
								It relies on the honesty of its users to make a donation if they can afford to. Donations allow me to keep it 								free, so if you like what I'm doing here then please support the site, don't leave it for "everyone else": 								make a&nbsp;
								<a href="http://justinguitar.com/en/AA-004-PleaseDonate.php" target="_blank">donation</a>
								.&nbsp; Thanks for your support!

									Got back from Los Angeles yesterday, got the new We Came As Strangers album finished and mixed, just needs to be mastered and we'll be good to go! Came together really well and was a real great fun making it - though we had to pull a few all night mixing sessions which were kinda hard work in a fun satisfying way... can't really call making music 'work' right? :) <a href="en/WCAS-WeCameAsStrangers.php">Please pre-order the album here</a> if you wanna support our project!
								</p>
								<p style = "align: justify;">
									Got a massive to do list going on this week, need to get the lessons for the new jazz series Standard Saturdays filmed (I'd done some before but wasn't happy with them) and also the new Recording Techniques series should be up soon... all the ground work for both is pretty much done, just gotta crack on with  filming / editing / web pages. Also got a bunch of other lessons I been meaning to do since forever that I wanna get ticked off.
								</p>
								<p style = "align: justify;">
									London Marathon is just 6 nights away now, trying to relax and 'carbo load' this week and thenjust have to get on with it - very much looking forward to being done with it and having a chilled couple of months off training before having to hit it again before my Nepal climbing expedition later in the year. I've reached the target for <a href="http://fundraise.unicef.org.uk/MyPage/RunGuitarRun" target="_blank">raising money for UNICEF - but contributions still very much appreciated</a>!
								</p>
								<p style = "align: justify;">
									I better get myself busy and get these new lessons filmed for y'all.
								</p>
								<p style = "align: justify;">
									Hope all is going great for you and wishing you much love and laughter! J
