					<h1>Stop, Hey, what's that sound?</h1>

					<p>
						﻿Aural Training (or ear training) is a very important part of musical development. Learning to recognise sounds will help you in many ways, most importantly it will help you Transcribe and accelerate your ability to work out songs on your own.
					</p>

					<p>
						It really can be quite incredible and I have had many students say that after a few months of consistent work on Aural Training that they can hear music better, that they can separate the instruments easier and hear new depths in recordings they thought they knew well.
					</p>

					<p>
						I grew up transcribing, it was the  way I learned to play songs, but when I started doing Interval Ear Training it took it to a whole new level. Doing a lot of transcribing will teach you the intervals sonically and to some extent on the neck, but once you know the names of the intervals too it makes it easier because you can 'put a tag on it' and know for sure what it is. Learning the names of the intervals is also great for communicating ideas with other musicians and understanding harmonic analysis.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Harmonic vs Melodic Intervals </strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						There are two types of interval listening, harmonic and melodic. In harmonic intervals the notes are played at the same time and in melodic the notes are played one after the other. Easy to remember: Melodic Intervals make melody, Harmonic Intervals make harmony! I recommend that people start with Ascending Melodic Intervals, then once that is mastered move on to Descending Melodic Intervals. Only when both of these are rock solid should a student approach Harmonic Intervals and chord structures.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Rhythmic Dictation</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						The other part of aural training that is very useful is rhythmic dictation. This is best done by writing the rhythms when you transcribe, but it can be pretty tricky and hard to just start doing it. The best way to get going is to learn to read and understand the notation and then practice tapping out the various rhythms - check out my eBook called&nbsp;<a href="PR-012-UnderstandingRhythmicNotation.php">Understanding Rhythm Notation</a>, a book full of rhythms... pages and pages of rhythms to read, and a load of instruction on how to read and it's progressive, going from simple 8th notes to complex syncopated 16th not patterns. If you go through it you will really know all your rhythms very well indeed and writing down the rhythms you hear will be a lot easier because you will already know what they sound like!
