								Learning songs by ear is the 'real way' to learn. Music is about hearing right, so doesn't it make sense to learn it by doing the same thing? It's how all the great mastered learned to play and I strongly suggest that you work on this too!

					<h1>The lost art of transcribing...</h1>

					<p>
						﻿Transcribing is the art of working out songs by ear. Much better than using TAB because it develops far more skills, makes you use your ears and knowledge! If you think about it,&nbsp;<strong>music is all about listening</strong>, right? Doesn't it make sense that the best way to learn it is by listening too?
					</p>
					<p>
						The actual term transcribe means to write it down (the scribe part of the word), and although this also has many benefits, the main thing you should aim to get down here is the working out the songs by ear, the writing down bit is just useful if you forget it later!
					</p>
					<p>
						If there was one skill that I think many people miss it is this. And it's such an important skill.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Learning to transcribe WILL transform your playing and get you more in touch with the guitar and help you tap into the music that lives inside you!</strong>

					<h2>The Transcribing Course</h2>

					<p>
						I have a lot of plans for this course but when I started I kinda hoped that people would be getting into it, but not many people were doing the course and even fewer parted with the £1 for the extra, and I struggle to make time for to make these lessons, they are a huge amount of work, so it's 'on hold' for a bit, I will get back it to at some point. There will be some video lessons but mostly audio, it is after all a transcribing course and it's going to be better if you are working with your ears and not your eyes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="homepage.html">TR-100 • &nbsp; Transcribing Course Introduction</a>
						<br>
						A video and text about this course, who it is aimed out, how the course will run and how to make the most of it! You probably want to check this out before you begin!
