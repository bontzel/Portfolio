						Welcome to Justin's Intermediate Guitar Method :)  I've tried out many different recipes trying to get the flavours just right! And I think now I have got a really solid, fun and progressive series together for you!
					</p>

					<p>
						The idea here is that you complete the five "Foundation" stages which will give you all the basic techniques and skills you need to start work on the Style Modules, where you will put all those skills into practice! The reason being that I guess everybody wants to start working on different things at this level, not everyone wants to do jazz or thrash metal! So this way, you get the skill set and then apply it to styles you like.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many of the lesson here are things that are already around the site but I know many of you struggle with getting the order right (and I would have too!!) the the big deal here is giving you some structure to the huge amount of things there are to learn on on our beautiful instruments!
					</p>
					<p>
						There are some "Essential Development Modules" (like <a href="PC-000-Practice.php">Effective Practice</a>,<a href="AU-000-AuralTraining.php"> Aural Training</a> and <a href="TR-000-Transcribing.php">Transcribing</a>) that you can check out at any time, during the Foundation, or during the Style Modules - up to you - they are kinda independent of other stuff, but no less important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you have finished five or more of the Style Modules you should be a "Player" and ready to to really fully explore any style that you wish to! Remember that there is never an end to learning, you just have to chose where it is you want to go and then figure out how to get there!

					<h2> Intermediate Foundation 1</h2>

					<p>
						In this first stage of the Foundation we are looking at many of the concepts that we will be exploring through the other stages as we continue, Barre chords, 16th note rhythms, The Major Scale, Notes on the fingerboard - all sorts of interesting stuff. You should find these Intermediate Foundation stages take a little longer than the beginner ones did. There is more to do and many of the things will take longer to explore properly. Take your time and do it well - there is no hurry here! Hope you enjoy it!
