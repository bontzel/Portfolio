								﻿Let's get started by looking at some of the most common questions I get asked about learning the guitar. The guitar is an easy instrument to play badly, but with practice anyone can learn to play well. In this lesson I just want to clear up a few things so that you know what to expect of this course, and of yourself.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have tried to answer many of the questions in the video, but the cool thing about these web pages is that I can update them easily (try doing that with a book!) and it means that I can add any new questions here as text, so please check that bit too before you post a question in the forum!

					<h2>F.A.Q...</h2>

					<p>
						<strong>* Please read these questions below (and the next few lessons) before posting your question on the forum, as most of the questions being asked seem to covered already in one of these few lessons! *</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Am I too old to start learning the guitar?</strong>
						<br>
						I find it amusing that I get this question a lot... from 16 year olds! You are never too old to start playing and enjoying guitar. Sure, you will read about the guitar legends we all admire, and how they started when they were six months old and were playing the Albert Hall by the time they were two, but that's not the case for most guitarists. It seems that about a quarter of the people using my website are over 50 years old and loving it. It's a wonderful hobby and I have had a few students in their 50s that started gigging regularly after a few years practice; a couple even turned professional! So it is never too late.
					</p>

					<p>
						One thing to be aware of however is that children do tend to learn faster than adults. I've been surprised time and time again at how quickly children between 12–18 learn stuff. I guess because they are still growing they develop the muscles in their hands faster, but they also have less pre-conceived ideas about what might be difficult to learn. Many grown-ups will hear a song and think “that sounds amazing, I bet it's very hard to play” and struggle if they try, whereas an 18 year old will hear the same thing and think “that sounds amazing, I want to learn that” and then do it without thinking about how hard it might be. Just remember it's mostly about practice time: put in a lot of time and you'll get good, no matter what your age!&nbsp;
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>How quickly will I be able to play songs?</strong>
						<br>
						You should be able to play a basic song or two after about three to five hours of practice (over a week or more—not in one go). It probably won't sound perfect, but it will at least be recognizable. How much time it takes you to learn the basics will depend almost totally on how much you practise. Note that if I give a recommended practice time—say, five minutes— it means five minutes of intense practice, not half-watching TV or answering phone calls or whatever. Try to stay focused when you practise, and then you can ‘free up' when you play ‘for real'.
