						Welcome to my beginners guitar course. It starts at the very beginning, and offers you advise about the very first steps that need to be taken (like buying an instrument) and what to expect on this fun and rewarding (and sometimes frustrating) journey that is learning to play the guitar. I know this course works because I have developed it over 20 years with many hundreds of students of ages and abilities, and I aim to start you off on a really well structured, enjoyable and motivating course that will have you playing songs in as shorter time as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are, of course, many ways to learn the guitar. I'd like to think that my method is the most effective method and fun available anywhere, partly because I continue to refine it as more people ask questions in the web site forum. It has become highly interactive and by asking questions you help me improve the course, and being that well over ten thousand people have used this course already, there have been many small improvements made since it's launch in June 2009.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>How To Use This Course</strong>
						<br>
						Of course you can adapt it to fit your prior knowledge and personal situation and just pick out lessons as you want them, but I would suggest reading the whole method even if you think you know something already. Make sure you leave no gaps in your knowledge by just watching or reading through all the lessons... you may find a few little nuggets of knowledge that help put it all together for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The JUSTIN Method (Just Use Sound To Improve Now)</strong>
						<br>
						So what makes this one special? the J.U.S.T.I.N. method! What? Yeah - I managed to use my name to make a silly acronym to define my own method (my middle name is megalomaniac!). Learning to use your ear in the early stages of learning is the thing that I believe will make you a much better player than any other method I have ever seen taught. It leads to the the skill of transcribing. Something that is missing from most methods, but is the way that all the great guitarists of previous generations got so good, and why so many guitarists these days are a bit rubbish.
