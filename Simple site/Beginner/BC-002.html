								In this lesson I give you a run down of the different types and what I think you should be looking for as a beginner, and explain the options and reasoning to you. Like with everything else on the course, I want you to understand why, not just follow things blindly!
							</p>
							<p>
								I have tried to answer many of the questions in the video, but the cool thing about these web pages is that I can update them easily (try doing that with a book!) and it means that I can add any new questions here as text, so please check that bit too before you post a question in the forum!

						One of the most frequently asked questions from beginner players is whether to choose electric or acoustic. The advice here is my view. Others may disagree, and they are welcome to their opinion; mine is subject to change without notice!

					<h2>The Big Beginners Debate</h2>

					<p>
						The basic types are
					</p>

					<p>
						i) Electric (including hollow bodied or semi-acoustics)
						<br>
						ii) Acoustic (steel strings - including those with electrics fitted, so called electro acoustics)
						<br>
						iii) Classical (nylon strings).
					</p>

					<p>
						Note that ‘semi-acoustics' are not really acoustic— they are electric guitars with a semi-hollow body, and so are sometimes confusingly referred to as semi-acoustics. However, they play like electrics.
					</p>

					<p>
						Also note that electro-acoustics are not electric guitars. They are acoustic instruments with electronics fitted so that they can be amplified, but you would not normally need to plug them in to get a good sound out of them.
					</p>

					<p>
						Many people think that electric guitars are going to be loud when they are plugged in... well, they do have a volume control, so you can control the volume. Also, be aware that you do not have to plug them in! I do probably half of my practice on electric guitar without any amp at all. It's good to get the notes ringing out loud and clear without an amp, so as a beginner you might want to put all your money into getting a cool guitar and leave getting an amp until later.
